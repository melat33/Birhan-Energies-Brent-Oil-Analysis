# Assumptions & Limitations

## Assumptions:
- 1. Market Efficiency: Prices incorporate information quickly
- 2. Event Isolation: Events can be analyzed independently
- 3. 30-Day Window: Captures most event impacts
- 4. Data Quality: Historical records are accurate
- 5. Stationarity: Returns are approximately stationary for modeling

## Limitations:
- CRITICAL: Correlation ≠ Causation
-    • Statistical association doesn't prove causation
-    • Temporal proximity suggests but doesn't confirm impact
-    • Confounding variables may influence results
-    • Multiple simultaneous events create attribution challenges
